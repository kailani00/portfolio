 <h1> Kai's Day</h1>
<p> Today was very stressful. I am having a hard time understanding python and coding concepts. 
similarities: The motions of the "turtle" 
  differences: the fact that you have to write out the code.
 I didnt like debugging the code it was hard.
  Day 2
  i enjoyed my day alot. it was much easier today and i worked alot harder.</p>
